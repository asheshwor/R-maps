Mapping techniques in R
---------
This is a collection of R code for visualizing spatial data. The different types of mapping techniques portrayed here are discussed below. As I explore more techniques, they will be added to the list.

1. Simple country map with point data added
----------
In this example, point data is mapped onto a country map.

2. Great circle map
----------
Points across the globe are connected using great circle arcs in this example. An excellent way to visualize global inter-connections.
